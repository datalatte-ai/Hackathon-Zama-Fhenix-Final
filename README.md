# datalatte: Privacy-Preserving Data Monetization Demo

Welcome to the datalatte demo repository. This project showcases how datalatte enables privacy-preserving primary and secondary data monetization between data owners and insight buyers, powered by homomorphic encryption technologies from Zama and Fhenix.

## Introduction
In this demo, data owners can connect with their digital wallets and answer four simple questions. Each answer is encrypted using homomorphic encryption and stored in a smart contract.

Insight buyers have two primary functions: 

1. To find a target audience (primary data collection)
2. To gain insights about the population pool (secondary data collection)

### Primary Data Collection
For primary data collection, insight buyers can set filters based on the examples provided in the four questions. The cost is automatically calculated based on the number of active filter settings. Following this, insight buyers have two options:

- View all wallet addresses matching the filter criteria. Note that this method of targeting, while direct, may be considered intrusive, as it reveals the wallet addresses. In future updates, we plan to allow insight buyers to send surveys to these addresses without revealing their identities or wallet details.

### Secondary Data Collection
When it comes to secondary data collection, we allow the insight buyer to gain knowledge about the percentage of the population that matches their custom filters. Once the insight buyer pays the query price in the network's native token, the percentage of the total population matching the profile is calculated and provided.

## Scope
Please note that this is a limited demo. While it does not represent the full capabilities of datalatte, it showcases a powerful use case for the application of homomorphic encryption in privacy-preserving, consent-based targeting and anonymous surveys.

## Getting Started
